## Introduction

Tea plantation management faces challenges due to inefficient monitoring of vast areas. **SkyT** addresses this by leveraging drones and IoT devices for sensor data (soil quality, temperature, humidity) and high-resolution imagery, automating data collection and visualization for proactive crop management.

---

## Solution Architecture

Our architecture integrates hardware and cloud components:

![Solution Architecture](./images/solutionarchitecture.png)

**Main Components:**
- **Sensor Node:** ESP32-based unit with RS485 NPK & pH sensors, DHT11 humidity sensor, solar/battery powered, BLE-activated.
- **Drone:** Raspberry Pi-powered, captures aerial images and gathers sensor data via BLE.
- **Docking Station:** ESP32 + 4G dongle, receives data from drone via LoRa and transmits to AWS cloud.
- **Cloud Backend:** AWS-hosted, with separate Flask (IoT) and TypeScript (dashboard) backends, all data stored in MySQL.
- **Web Dashboard:** Built in React.js + Bootstrap, role-based access, real-time data and image visualization.

---

## Hardware and Software Designs

### Software Design

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Bootstrap, dynamic dashboard, role-based UI/UX.
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express, TypeScript, REST API, MySQL2, JWT authentication, hosted on Vercel.
- **Database:** MySQL (main), MongoDB (auxiliary).
- **Cloud:** AWS for backend services, Cloudflare for frontend hosting.

_Recent improvements include:_
- Enhanced authentication (including image-based auth and access denied pages)
- Real-time dashboard data, notification system, and drone control hooks
- Improved API structure and error handling
- Task lifecycle management and advanced permissioning
- Gallery for drone image uploads

### Hardware Design

- ESP32 sensor node with Modbus RS485 soil sensor and DHT11
- Drone integration with Pi Zero/Pi 4 and camera module
- Docking with LoRa and 4G connectivity

---

## Testing

- Backend: Automated tests using Jest + Supertest
- Manual API testing with Postman
- Hardware: Sensor and communication integration tested in field conditions
