## Introduction

Tea plantation management faces challenges due to inefficient monitoring of vast areas. **SkyT** addresses this by leveraging drones and IoT devices for sensor data (soil quality, temperature, humidity) and high-resolution imagery, automating data collection and visualization for proactive crop management.

---

## Solution Architecture

Our architecture integrates hardware and cloud components:

![Solution Architecture](./images/solutionarchitecture.png)

**Main Components:**
- **Sensor Node:** ESP32-based unit with RS485 NPK & pH sensors, DHT11 humidity sensor, solar/battery powered, BLE-activated.
- **Drone:** Raspberry Pi-powered, captures aerial images and gathers sensor data via BLE.
- **Docking Station:** ESP32 + 4G dongle, receives data from drone via LoRa and transmits to AWS cloud.
- **Cloud Backend:** AWS-hosted, with separate Flask (IoT) and TypeScript (dashboard) backends, all data stored in MySQL.
- **Web Dashboard:** Built in React.js + Bootstrap, role-based access, real-time data and image visualization.

## Hardware and Software Designs

---

### Software Design
SkyT features a robust and scalable full-stack architecture with clearly separated concerns between the frontend, backend, and cloud integrations.

#### Frontend
  - Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite for a fast, modular, and modern development experience.
  - Uses Material UI (MUI) for a consistent and responsive user interface.
  - Integrates React Router DOM for protected and nested route management.
  - Includes Leaflet and Google Maps API for geospatial visualizations of estates and drone positions.
  - Utilizes MUI X Charts for real-time data visualization of environmental metrics (NPK, humidity, temperature).

#### Backend
  - Powered by Node.js + Express with TypeScript, following a modular REST API design.
  - Implements MySQL2 with connection pooling for efficient database access.
  - Features JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.
  - Deployed on AWS EC2, ensuring rapid and scalable serverless function support.
  - Handles secure file uploads, task concurrency, and drone control through integrated service hooks.
    
#### Database
  - MySQL with relational integrity and indexing for optimized queries.
  - Structured tables for estates, lots, nodes, sensor readings, images, users, and tasks.
  - Supports JSON field optimization for mapping task-lot relationships.

#### Cloud & DevOps
  - Cloudflare hosts the frontend for fast global delivery.
  - GitHub Actions automate build and deployment workflows (CI/CD).
  - Nodemailer provides email verification and notification capabilities.
  - External APIs such as AccuWeather enhance weather-based decisions.

#### Advanced Features
  - Real-time dashboard with periodic backend validation for token and session.
  - Custom middleware for authentication, error handling, and role-based permissions.
  - Image compression and secure storage with naming conventions tied to user IDs.
  - Time-series data filtering by node, date range, and value thresholds.
  - Notification system for alerts (e.g., sensor out-of-range, new image uploads).
  - Fully documented REST API endpoints and test cases using Jest + Supertest.
  - Authentication-based image accessing method.
